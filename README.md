## 📋 About The Project
**EduCodes** is a web-based MVP (Minimum Viable Product) designed as a prototype for an educational startup business plan. The platform aims to teach programming concepts through interactive visual simulations rather than just text.

Although this version serves as a frontend prototype without a persistent database, it features fully functional logic simulators that demonstrate algorithmic concepts in real-time.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Interactive Simulators:** Logic-based modules where users can see code execution visually.
* **Course Catalog:** responsive layout displaying available learning paths.
* **User Interface:** Clean, modern, and intuitive design for students.
* **Mock Functionality:** Login and registration forms with frontend validation logic.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Core:** HTML5, CSS3.
* **Scripting:** Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+) for DOM manipulation and simulator logic.
* **Design:** Custom responsive CSS (Flexbox/Grid).

## 👨‍💻 My Contributions
As the Lead Frontend Developer for this project, I focused on the core logic and user experience:

* **Developed the Simulator Logic:** Designed and implemented the JavaScript algorithms that power the interactive coding simulators, ensuring immediate feedback for user inputs.
* **UI/UX Architecture:** Structured the responsive layout using modern CSS techniques to ensure the platform works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices.
* **DOM Manipulation:** Created dynamic interactions within the application without relying on third-party frameworks, demonstrating strong fundamentals in Vanilla JavaScript.
* **Form Validation:** Implemented client-side logic to handle user inputs and guide the navigation flow.

## 🔧 How to Run
Since this is a static web application, no server installation is required:
1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Locate the `index.html` file.
3.  Open it in any modern web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox).
